\chapter{Introduction}
This primer is intended for a reader who has a working knowledge of Python 3 and want to start to learn how to program in C. It is by no means a substitute to an "Introduction to Programming" course, but rather something meant to bridge the gap between the transferable knowledge of programming concepts the reader have learnt prior, to writing code in C. 

As a primer, this book is not meant to be a complete guide to the C programming language as well - there are features of the language which will be skipped or glossed over; the book is meant to give the readers a quick start to start writing code in C. As a feature, this primer will contain some examples and highlights on the differences between C and Python 3.

This work builds and adapts upon the contents from "C for Python programmers" by Carl Burch, used under CC BY-SA 3.0 US and "C for Java Programmers" by George Ferguson, used under CC BY-SA 4.0.

This work is created partly as an (unofficial) supplementary material for the CS2100 course in the National University of Singapore.
